# Getting Started with Create React App

About Project :- 
Real-time CodeEditor web application built with socket.io here any person can create a room by generating a unique room id and or can join a room by entering a username and passing the room id. Anyone can then utilize it for real-time coding needs. Useful for coding interviews and solving problems with friends.
In this code editor different users can simultaneously work on code, scripts and projects by creating a room secured through unique id from uuid v4 npm package. and here users can work, share and contribute to the code or scripts in real time. Only authorised persons who are part of the group(room) can view and contribute to the code.
I have try to built something different but stiil need help. Any person help me to add database feature to this app,So that user leave the room or close the window accidently then code of that room will preserved in database.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
